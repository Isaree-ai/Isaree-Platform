## Medical-Grade AI Assistant & Orchestration Platform

Isaree is an open-source, medical-compliant AI Assistant and Agent Orchestration Engine designed to transform healthcare workflows. Our platform combines privacy-preserving on-device processing with powerful cloud capabilities to deliver secure, efficient, and compliant AI solutions for healthcare professionals.

> **IMPORTANT**: Isaree is currently in development and not yet ready for clinical use. All components are provided for research and development purposes only.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: On-device processing for sensitive data with end-to-end encryption
- **Multi-Modal Input Processing**: Handle speech, text, and images with medical context awareness
- **Compliant by Design**: Designed from the ground up for HIPAA, GDPR, and other healthcare regulations
- **AI Agent Marketplace**: Ecosystem for specialized medical AI agents with rigorous verification
- **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinate multiple AI agents for complex healthcare workflows
- **Healthcare Integration**: Connect with existing healthcare systems through standard protocols

## Project Status

Isaree is in active development. We're building the foundation for a robust, medical-grade AI platform and invite contributors to join us in this mission. Currently, we're focusing on:

- Core architecture and infrastructure
- Security and compliance frameworks
- Client-side processing capabilities
- Agent orchestration protocols

## Getting Started

> Note: As Isaree is in early development, these instructions will evolve as the project matures.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for containerized development)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/isaree/isaree.git
cd isaree

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development environment
npm run dev
```

## Architecture Overview

Isaree consists of five main layers:

1. **Client Layer**: On-device AI assistant with privacy-preserving processing
2. **Security & Compliance Layer**: Ensures adherence to healthcare regulations
3. **Medical AI Agent Marketplace**: Ecosystem for specialized medical AI agents
4. **Medical-Grade AI Orchestration Platform**: Core orchestration engine
5. **Integration and Data Layers**: Connects with healthcare systems and data sources

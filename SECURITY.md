   - Implement proper backup procedures
   - Use secure deletion practices for sensitive data

3. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a firewall
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all connections
   - Implement network segmentation for healthcare environments

4. **Compliance**
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance for US deployments
   - Follow GDPR requirements for EU deployments
   - Maintain audit trails for all data access

5. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep Isaree and all dependencies up to date

## Healthcare-Specific Security Considerations

As a medical AI platform, Isaree has additional security considerations:

1. **PHI Protection**
   - All Protected Health Information (PHI) should be handled according to applicable regulations
   - Use the built-in anonymization features for any data sharing
   - Enable audit logging for all PHI access

2. **AI Model Security**
   - Validate AI models before deployment in clinical settings
   - Be aware of potential data poisoning or adversarial attacks
   - Implement human oversight for critical AI decisions

3. **Medical Device Regulations**
   - If using Isaree as part of a medical device, ensure compliance with relevant regulations (FDA, CE, etc.)
   - Maintain documentation of validation and verification processes
   - Implement risk management procedures

## Security Features
